                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello! First of all, a little about Robin Sharma and the core nature of his ideas and philosophy is in order, because, I believe, without an understanding of it, the whole idea might seem ridiculous. Robin is someone who looks at the positive side. Always. Any philosophy is based on either the positive outlook, or the negative outlook. While there is virtue in looking at the negative side, the positive side of affairs is not all children's story either. And this I am writing from experience. I have seem some really difficult times and Robin and his principles have really shown me the way. And as I absorbed his principles and I built upon them with what I learned elsewhere, I came to realize that there is really not that sharp of a distinction in what we choose to label positive or negative. It is the holes in our understanding of the fabric of philosophy that brings out discrepancies. For example, if one has a missing piece in their understanding, when faced with trying times, that require them to tap into that piece of the puzzle, they will find the philosophy as a whole unreal. And this happens with positive side more often, because, for one, there is no much negativity all around, and for the other, we, as as a species, are neurobiologically and psychologically more susceptible and prone to negativity than positivity. This trait is what makes us so resilient. We needed to be afraid, to be alive. We needed to fit into the herd, to be alive. And we needed to be aggressive, to be alive. But that was when we were cavemen. Our intellect as a species has grown. And that negativity bias only drags us down. In order to unleash one's full potential, it is important to take control of how we react to stimuli, and choose not to let negativity take its course of action. So, even though Robin's principles sound utopian, if absorbed deeply, and acted upon consistently, not just externally, but also internally, and by which I mean doing the work and modifications on one's way of looking at things, even in principle, his ideals are powerful. Powerful enough to shake the world in a gentle way. Which takes me to the first thing in the book. It is a quote.

                <h3>Definition of Victim</h3>
                <p>
                    We are taught to call someone a victim if they have unfavorable circumstances behind them. But in reality, who doesn't? Unfavorable circumstances are an unavoidable and I dare say, essential, part of life. Everyone has them. So then, is everyone a victim? One could choose to put it that way, or, one could look a little deeper. Upon further inspection, it seems victimhood has to do with debilitating effects of circumstances. Put in simpler words, if someone has some power stripped away from them, they could be called victims. But if it is indeed so, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr., and many more were certainly victims and not leaders. But we know it is the other way around. And yes I am aware I made it sound like leadership is the opposite of victimhood, and I'll will go on to establish that to fair satisfaction. Now how did these great men who had their power, even fundamental human rights, stripped away from them, rise to legendary leadership? That contradiction arises from an ambiguity in the definition of power.

            <section id="power">
                <h3>Definition of Power</h3>
                <p>
                    What is power? Some title, or authority, or label? Or something more materialistic like money? Or some otherworldly capabilities? The suggestion here is, to define power as one's resolve to take personal responsibility and accountability for all things in their life, personal, professional, or otherwise. Let me walk this idea a little more, because this is so fundamental to the entire philosophy we are talking about? It all starts with a simple resolve to take charge and responsibility for one's own life, rather than call out on circumstances. It is such a fundamental thing we all grow up with. We find it so easy to shake off responsibility by saying, due to such and such circumstances, the current condition is such and such. Whereas, if we take responsibility, we must take the blame. And we are either scared, or have gotten so used to this way, that we shake off responsibility. This nature of chasing unaccountability makes us give up our power, at a very subconscious level, to things around us, people, circumstances and what not. And it is almost devious, how this little shift in perspective changes our entire mindset.

            <section id="responsibility">
                <h3>Definition of Responsibility</h3>
                <p>
                    First of all, the past that we carry on our shoulders, we do so to use it as something we can shift responsibility to. So once we are willing to take responsibility, that becomes unnecessary and we find it easier to let go of that baggage. The perspective shifts from past to future. Also, with this comes the realization that we need to do our best because we are answerable, not to someone else, but to ourselves, to our own conscience, and our conscience knows really well what we are truly capable of. In other words, we take responsibility for our past and current state of our life, and for every pocket of time to come, and thus, we take power in our hands. And the more responsibility we take, the more power we take. With every bit of responsibility we take away from circumstances, onto ourselves, we take power away from circumstances into our own hands. And therefore, like I said at the outset. Responsibility is power. And then we use this power to do our very best and in doing so rise from victimhood to leadership. Nelson Mandela could have said he spent a major portion of his life in prison, and didn't have money to back him up, and was oppressed, so he was powerless to bring change. But he chose to take responsibility, and therefore, gained power. The same can be said about all the great leaders.

            <section id="leadership">
                <h3>Definition of Leadership</h3>
                <p>
                    What is leadership, then, is the next question that needs insight. By leadership, we readily associate labels and titles and positions. But in reality, is it even possible to make an impact with a label? No more than you can expect someone to become a swimmer by putting on swimming gear. Impact can only achieved by example. And so, leadership is very much self-leadership. To commit to taking complete responsibility for oneself is leadership. Leadership is leading the self. It is fundamentally impossible to lead others. And there shouldn't be a need to. Everyone is their own person, after all. And it is equally possible and ideally desirable for every individual to be a leader. And that is done by taking responsibility and power. And that is precisely all one needs to be a leader. It is imperative to realize that all the power we need to be the leader of our lives, and to reach the greatness that we all deeply seek is within us but the victim mindset has trained us to give it up to circumstances and as a result, end us following the herd and the drift of the masses. And that is why I proposed that victim and leadership are polar opposites. And that, I took directly from Robin. And this model of leadership doesn't ask for any title, and there stand the name of the book, 'The Leader Who Had No Title'. No matter what one does, no matter where one is coming from in life, and no matter where one wants to go. This change is perspective holds the key to unlocking a greater state of being.

            <section id="conclusion">
                <h3>Looking forward</h3>
                <p>
                    The book presents perspective optimizations, tactics and suggestions to explore this leadership philosophy in depth. But right at the very onset, it is imperative to mark that no philosophy will ever work, unless one is willing to do the work. And it will not be easy. But then nothing of value comes easy, because if it did, everyone would have it, and so it wouldn't have any special value. And since today marks as 'Teacher's Day' where I am from, this is for my mentor and teacher, Robin. That is it for today. I'll see you around.
