                    In the last episode, got my Fedora Linux installed, and I had all the software (packages in Linux terminology) that I needed. Now I was starting to run into troubles. I faced issues playing multimedia files, like music or videos. The commands also were weird, since I had no experience, whatsoever. I was having issues finding help on the internet, because not many people seemed to be using Fedora, and even though this was also Linux, this one was quite different from the popular ones, like Ubuntu, in the sense, that the commands that worked there wouldn't work here, the internal file system, which determines which system files are located where, was different, and so on. Another problem was that I couldn't really connect to the internet. Okay it sounds worse than it was. I could connect to the internet but some sites would open, others wouldn't. Overall, one thing that I wouldn't deny, is that it was a huge letdown of an experience. It felt like a perplexing, inescapable maze. And soon I wasn't using it at all. It was just there.

                    I would have given up on Linux, and assumed that it was out of my intellectual budget but during all my time that I spent to research the internet, about ways to sort this or that issue, that I came across while setting up Fedora, I learned that distros were a big factor in Linux, and Fedora wasn't anywhere near the more usable on the list. To add to that the Fedora I was using was really out of date or something. And to some extent all this overwhelmed me too much to even try to learn, what it was good for, major reason being, I had an easier resort - just boot into Windows. And I couldn't stop going back to Win as the most basic things like multimedia wasn't working on Fedora. So with all this in my mind, I knew better than to give up on Linux for good, instead, I just gave up on Fedora, and decided get to another proper Linux set up. And time just flew by. Around four years passed and about 2 months back a friend said he's getting a Kali Linux set up, and I knew by now, what Kali Linux meant. Before I could even think of anything, I asked him to give me a copy. And... 3... 2... 1... Achievement unlocked - Kali Linux obtained!

                    But my machine stopped working the same day. I know, I know, I was born so lucky you'd be jealous! My exams were up soon, so I didn't bother getting into this right then, I let my exams end and let things settle down somewhat. Then I got my machine repaired the last day of October and the next day, got into this. But by then I had enough time to carry out sufficient background research on whether I really wanted to go with Kali Linux or something else, whether I was ready to remove Windows for good and switch completely to Linux, etc. And I decided to get Kali Linux. And then I got the software I used. Just like the previous time. And that is when this series of blogs came into existence. The story continues in the upcoming issues.

                    By now you must be wondering what this Linux distro business is. I have been talking about it without giving any insight into it. you may be wondering how it could have so much impact on the experience even though it is the same operating system, underneath. To understand this let's take a moment to rewind the clock.

                    In the early 1990's, a student at University of Helsinki, named Linus Torvalds took up a personal project - to create a free operating system, or OS, similar to MINIX, which was a UNIX like OS.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    Here, a note on the history of OS is in order. The very first computers were huge devices that did relatively simple mathematical calculations, for these, an OS was not needed. The next generation of computers were relatively more capable in the sense that they could process a batch of data and this called for a software between the machine and the actual program doing the processing to manage the batch of tasks to be done, this was the first ever OS. Then come in, multiprocessing capable computers, and naturally a need for more capable OS, now to manage the batch of tasks to be done as well as the various tasks being done simultaneously. This is where OS started being taken seriously and names like UNIX came up. To keep it simple UNIX was pretty much one of the very first multitasking capable OS and even more so one that is still alive 33 years later. The Unix was licensed to many organizations which modified the original UNIX to suit their needs better. Soon some independent creators made OS similar to UNIX. One such was MINIX, as in mini-UNIX. Then we get personal computers in the last quarter of 20th century and then it was increasingly important that OS be accessible to as many users as possible, as not everyone using a personal computer was expected to a professional. And that is when Microsoft rolls out as a budding software firm, which Apple hires to make the OS for it's PC's. But as Apple rolls out Mac OS, Microsoft decides to roll out it's own OS - Windows, and then comes the revolution in personal computing, the 'Graphical User Interface or GUI'.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    An OS is basically just an agent that does the talking between the application, which is the program that determines what needs to be done and the machine that does it. In other words, the application tells the OS, what needs to be done, and the OS collects this list of 'what' from various applications, or various 'what' from the same application and tells it to the machine, one at a time in an order and manner that best utilizes the resources available, so as to complete all the 'what', that needed to be done in the most efficient manner, and takes the result of the calculation and gives it back to the application that asked for it. But that would be the minimal OS, or the kernel, as we call it. There is a lot of room there to add in various utilities, that enhance various functions. Like GUI, the real time digital clock we are so used to having on our computers, the access to internet, the ability to play multimedia files are all utilities. So, as things stand, an actual acceptable OS has a kernel and a set of utilities.
                </p><br>
                    
                <p>
                    Now let us get back to Linus. In 1994, comes the v1.0 of the kernel of this operating system, which he called Linux, from LINUs and uniX. But this was just the kernel. Around the same time FSF, or Free Software Foundation, set out to make their own free OS, which they called GNU, which comic as I find it, stands for GNU's Not UNIX, (yes it is a recursive acronym, i.e. the GNU in the expanded form has the same expansion again, infinitely) but they started with working on the utilities first. And as it happened, they decided to use Linux kernel and thus we had out first complete GNU/Linux, or what we commonly call Linux. And it was available for free for everyone, and continues to be so, to this day. Now various hobbyists and professionals got their hands on this. And what do you do when you get a new house? You modify it to suit your needs and tastes. So these people did the same. And thus we have various modifications on Linux, and that's what distros are. An undeniably important thing to mention here would be that since it was free, anyone could work on it, and that was a key reason it developed much more quickly, variedly and yet flexibly, that today the majority of the internet runs on servers running Linux, Android is based on Linux, and even supercomputers run Linux.

                    Lastly, you're thinking why the weird name, 'Hackers Love Unicorns & Magic', it's your lucky day. So what happened is that when I was installing Kali Linux, I noticed two terms that caught my attention, 'unicorn' and 'magic'. Naturally, this was curious, so I ran a web search of the terms and it turns out it's some tool used for stuff which can be called hacking in layman terms. So naturally it struck me as an amusing little piece of info. Now, when I was thinking about a name for this blog series, I was looking for something around the word 'hacker', as Linux is a hacker thing, but I also wanted it to be something that struck the curiosity of whoever was reading it. And this name miraculously dawned upon me. I'll see you around.
