                   I genuinely love to read. And a lot of the books I read are based off philosophy, productivity and growth. Someone I genuinely think of as a personal mentor always says, "Teacher learns the most". Even though I wouldn't dare to pass myself off as a teacher, or anything close to that, I believe ideas, especially philosophical are largely abstract, and based on one's experiences, one draws interpretations and insights out of it. What I am implying here, I believe, is that the same books talks differently to me than it does to someone else. In this series of blogs, I'll talk about my opinions and interpretations of some of the books I read, insights I draw, how they have brought impact into my life, and other commentary as I see fit.
