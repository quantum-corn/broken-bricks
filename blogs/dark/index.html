                   If you have read some of my blogs, or about me I have made references to a phase of my life where I haven't been perfectly fine, mentally and emotionally. This series is a walk with me as I traverse my mind. I know it not something you write about in a blog. But I am. Maybe because I hope someone in need will someday read it and find help. Maybe because I want to leave a trail, I am not sure what for. Maybe I find therapy in this. Maybe all of the reasons above. But I must say,<br>
                   <br>
                   READ THIS WITH DISCRETION AND IT MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR YOU, IF YOU ARE TOO YOUNG (say, 20 or below).<br>
                   <br>
                   It is not a chronological account, but an interconnected mess that starts at the date of publishing of the first issue and mostly moves forward with some light being cast on past which might not make much sense until a few issues cover some ground on past.<br>
                   <br>
                   And lastly this is just me and my mind. I do not intend to imply anything by what is in here.
