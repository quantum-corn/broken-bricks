            <h3>The New Picture Of Reality</h3>
            <p>
                For a long time, we have known the rules that govern the very reality we exist in. But that government seems to be quite unstable for every few decades, some new scam gets exposed and voila! There comes a new governing order. Of all such events in the history of human knowledge, none has been more profound or arguably most disturbing than, <i>drumrolls in the background</i>, <b>Quantum Theory</b>. With the advent of Quantum Theory, the picture of reality changed quite a bit. Some new rules governing the reality came into the light. Some well established ideas had to be scrapped. Let's take a look at the new picture of reality.
            </p>

            <h3>Quantization</h3>
            <p>
                The very foundation and also the beginning of Quantum Theory happens to be something known as  Quantization. First, light, which was thought of as waves previously, was established to also behave as particles in situations where it interacts with other forms of matter, say electrons. This was essential, to make sense of some phenomena we observed, and without this change in our picture, some nasty discrepancies kept coming up. It was Einstein who came up with this suggestion. He said, if light were to be thought of as a barrage of light particles, like bullets instead of a stream, like that of water, then there is an explanation to the observations of the Photoelectric effect. This idea was previously suggested by Max Planck, while he was working to explain the phenomenon of radiation of light, without which, things seemed to be radiating infinite energy, which is plain impossible. I'd re-affirm that saying that light behaves as a particle didn't mean that it isn't a wave anymore. While it is not interacting with any matter, say, while it is traveling between two points in space, it would behave as a wave. This particle is simply a packet of pure energy called <i>photon</i>. In all common knowledge and experience we observe that the various quantities can take any values. But it was found later that at the fundamental level, the values that the quantities can take are quantized(this is where the name Quantum Theory comes from). Let me explain this with this example:
                Our previous knowledge was that quantities are like water, you can have any amount, i.e. the possible values is continuous. And now we understand that quantities are like counting electrons, you can have only integral values, \(1, 2, 3, 4\) electrons etc. and not \(\frac 1 2, \frac 5 4\) number of electrons etc. i.e. the values are a number of discreet chunks or packets. So it is not just light that became a particle, instead, all the quantities, became chunky.
            </p>

            <h3>The Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
            <p>
                This <em>weird</em> nature of light where it behaved both as a wave and as a particle came to called the wave particle duality. Then De Broglie (read: De Broy) argued that just like light wave also behave as particles, <em>wouldn't it be nice if</em>, particles also behaved as waves. He provided no evidence, no mathematical support whatsoever. His only convincing claim was a concern for the symmetry, simplicity and elegance of the resultant picture. His idea was indeed found to be correct. The wave nature of light was established by a class of optical experiments called interference experiments. It revolves around a direct observation of the phenomenon of interference. Later after Einstein and Planck proposed a particle nature for light, it was established experimentally by Compton's experiment or Compton effect. Particles being particles, well doesn't quite have to be established. No that's not how it works. It needs to be established at the scale of electrons. You may know that a ball in your hand is a ball, but you will need to experimentally verify that an electron is a particle. Anyway, that was done previously by Thomson. After De Broglie proposed his <em>'wouldn't be nice if...'</em>, Thomson's son, Thomson, also a physicist, carried out interference experiments with electrons and established that they did behave like waves and not like particles. The same experiment was later carried out with various other matters, even with C-60 aka Buckminster Fullerene, or Bucky balls, to eliminate the possibility that it was a unique property of some particles or of particles under a size limit. It all gave the same results. And Bucky balls are incomparably larger than electrons. And thus we have a reality that doesn't pick between waves or particles. It wants both. I have this strong urge to delve into some philosophy here, but I'll keep this to the point.
            </p><br>
                
            <p>
                It might be interesting to know a little about this De Broglie person. He was a historian by profession, a science historian. He subsequently developed a liking for physics to the extent that he gave up his career, pursued physics education and well, ended up getting a Nobel Prize this <em>'wouldn't be nice if...'</em> argument. You may want to call it a lucky break, but let me emphasize that even though science doesn't quite run by <em>'wouldn't it be nice if...'</em> type arguments, a well positioned argument of the nature, with concepts of symmetry or conservation or minimization of certain values, can be of valuable insight. Great physicists of the past have used terms like 'physical intuition' or 'instinct' to refer to the ability to anchor the laws of nature to such simple cornerstone concepts and reduce the complexity of the law. It is a valuable skill to refine for a physicist, but the sad state of affairs happens to be, that it is becoming a lost art as the noise of too much complexity is creeping into the flow of education of physics. I won't go into more details in this matter. Or you may want to call it genius, but like I said, a sharp instinct is worth its weight in terms of intellect, and while intellect may be a natural gift, instinct is often refined in the heat of experience and hard-work. Also all the other people I mentioned so far, got Nobel for their respective works. Another amusing fact is that daddy Thomson got the Nobel for saying electrons are particles, and junior Thomson got it for saying, on quite the contrary, that electrons are waves. Almost too funny or poetic.
            </p>
        
            <h3>The Uncertainty Principle</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to that, Heisenberg found that the various measurable properties of a particle can be grouped into pairs of two, called conjugate pairs, and it was fundamentally impossible to measure the two quantities together or in other words, it was impossible to exactly determine the value for both the conjugate pair quantities at the same time. He stated this as what is now known as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which goes as:
                The more accurately you know a quantity, the greater is the inaccuracy in the simultaneous knowledge of the other conjugate pair quantity. This was by far one of the most unsettling aspects of the  quantum theory. And if it didn't make you uncomfortable, let me emphasize it for you. If you know where the particle is, you know nothing about how fast or which way it is going. Also, if you know how fast and in which way a particle is going, you know nothing about where it might be <em>in the whole universe</em>. This led an almost amusing but insightful debate among the big shot physicists of the time. I will write about it at length  another time.
            </p>
        
            <h3>States</h3>
            <p>
                Since the system will now exhibit discreet values, we can define states for the system in which the system might be found when measurements are made. Simply said, think of a radio tuner vs. a fan regulator - the radio tuner is like the old picture, where the system can be just about anywhere, whereas the fan regulator can be at any one of 4 predetermined states, and nowhere else. Another example is, in a regular electrical circuit, the voltage at a point can be at about any value, but in a digital circuit, it can take one of two values, designated as \(0\) or \(1\). Similarly any quantum system can be represented as states. For example, the spin of an electron along an axis, can have either \(+\frac 1 2\) or \(-\frac 1 2\), one of the two states. All the information about the particle is contained in a mathematical complex (as in complex numbers: \(a+ib\)) function called wavefunctions. Wavefunctions are denoted by the greek letter Psi, \(\Psi\). And it is basically used to calculate the probability of the particle being in a certain state. A state is denoted by, say, for state A, \(\ket A\), or for state B, \(\ket B\).
            </p>

            <h3>Superposition</h3>
            <p>
                With the concept of states in our bag, what we see next, is the idea of superposition, which states:<br>
                When no measurement is being made, and the system left by itself, the system is in superposition of all possible states with varying probabilities.<br>
                What that means is that the system is not in a particular state, but in all the possible states with a certain probability of being in each state. If a system can be in state A or state B, only, we can say,
                <div class="boxed">
                    $$
                    \Psi=a\ket A+b\ket B
                    $$
                </div>
                where \(a\) and \(b\) are complex numbers. Here, \(|a|^2\) is the probability of the system being in state \(A\) and \(b^2\) is the probability of the system being in state \(B\). The system is in a superposition of state A and state B. Think of it like this, until we do the measurement, the system is in both state A and state B and as soon as the measurement is made, the system collapses to either state A or state B in accordance with the corresponding probabilities i.e. the probability of being in that state becomes one, and the probability of being in the other states becomes zero. That is by measuring the system, we disturb the system and force it to choose one state. Also,
                <div class="boxed">
                    $$
                    |a|^2+|b|^2=1
                    $$
                </div>
                which should be intuitive because the system has to be either in state \(A\) or state\(B\), after all, there is no other possibility. So, the total probability of all possible states must be \(1\) or \(100\%\). That is just like the total probability of heads and tails on a coin toss must be \(1\) as in every toss the outcome must one of the two.
            </p>

            <h3>Entanglement</h3>
            <p>
                Now let us imagine two particles, and we observe, that sometimes, their states are connected, e.g. let us consider two electrons, and we measure the spin of them along a certain axis and if we measure the spin of one to be \(\frac 1 2\), and we instantly force the other system's state to collapse down to \(\frac 1 2\). This means that these two particles do not have independent states, instead, are bound together in one state, or to say it simply, these two particles are described by just one state. Let's take 2 independent, i.e. non-interacting, particles, particle A, and particle B. Now, states of particle A, particle B and the overall system are,
                <div class="boxed">
                    $$
                    \begin{align*}
                    \Psi_A &= a_1\ket {A_1}+a_2\ket {A_2}\\
                    \Psi_B &= b_1\ket {B_1}+b_2\ket {B_2}\\
                    \Psi &= \Psi_A \otimes \Psi_B\\
                    &= \left(a_1\ket {A_1}+a_2\ket {A_2}\right) \otimes \left(b_1\ket {B_1}+b_2\ket {B_2}\right)\\
                    &= a_1 b_1\left(\ket {A_1}\otimes \ket {B_1}\right) + a_2 b_1\left(\ket {A_2}\otimes \ket {B_1}\right) + a_1 b_2\left(\ket {A_1}\otimes \ket {B_2}\right) + a_2 b_2\left(\ket {A_2}\otimes \ket {B_2}\right) \quad (1)
                    \end{align*}
                    $$
                </div>
                The above equation \((1)\) is the general form for the state of a 2 particle 2 state system.
                Now, if the particles are entangled, the states get tied up, for example, if particle A is in state \(A_1\), the particle B will be in state \(B_1\), and if particle A is in state \(A_2\), the particle B will be in state \(B_2\). Now the equation becomes,
                <div class="boxed">
                    $$
                    \begin{align*}
                    \Psi &= a_1 b_1\left(\ket {A_1}\otimes \ket {B_1}\right) + 0\left(\ket {A_2}\otimes \ket {B_1}\right) + 0\left(\ket {A_1}\otimes \ket {B_2}\right) + a_2 b_2\left(\ket {A_2}\otimes \ket {B_2}\right)\\
                    &= a_1 b_1\left(\ket {A_1}\otimes \ket {B_1}\right) + a_2 b_2\left(\ket {A_2}\otimes \ket {B_2}\right) \quad (2)
                    \end{align*}
                    $$
                </div>
                As you can observe with a little thinking, there is no possible set of values for \(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2\) that satisfies both the equations \((1) \& (2)\). So the equations can never be simultaneously true. Here, equation \((2)\) is the state representing 2 entangled particles, and equation \((1)\) is the state for non entangled particles. If you can write the state of a pair of particles as either, you would know whether the particles are entangled or not.
            </p>

            <h3>What to take home?</h3>
            <p>
                You can read equation \((1)\) as follows: The system can be in the following states when measured:<br>
                particle A in state \(A_1\) and particle B in state \(B_1\)<br>
                <br>
                particle A in state \(A_2\) and particle B in state \(B_1\)<br>
                <br>
                particle A in state \(A_1\) and particle B in state \(B_2\)<br>
                <br>
                particle A in state \(A_2\) and particle B in state \(B_2\)<br>
                and this is possible because the states of the two particles are independent, i.e. the state of B doesn't care what the state of A is.<br>
                <br>
                Whereas, you read equation \((2)\) as follows: The system can be in the following states when measured:<br>
                particle A in state \(A_1\) which means particle B in state \(B_2\)<br>
                <br>
                particle A in state \(A_2\) which means particle B in state \(B_1\)<br>
                and this is possible because the states of the two particles are entangled, i.e. the states of B are directly connected to the states of A.
