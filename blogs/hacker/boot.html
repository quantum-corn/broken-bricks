            <h3>The Dark Ages</h3>
            <p>
                In the days long long past, I had a dual boot Windows 7|Fedora Linux machine. And just so you know, I used to run an old hardware. Intel Pentium Core 2 Duo processor, 2 Gigs(geeky sounding Gigabyte) of memory and 250 Gigs Hard Disk Drive. So it was working for me with Win 7. Then I started to notice the mention of Linux and I had to try. I had always been into computers. From rooting Android phones to wiping the entire stock OS and installing custom OS on the phone, I have done all kinds of things. So you can guess I am the kind of person that would have to try Linux. And personal curiosity apart, Linux promised to be more powerful and run better on an old system like mine. It gave off that 'hacker vibe' and  who wouldn't want to feel that! Even though I cringe at who I used to be, I suppose we all go through that phase. As if all this wasn't enough, I also learned that it was supremely preferred over Win in the professional circle. I mean, as a physicist, I was more likely to be using Linux than Windows, so I decided to give it a shot.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now the question at hand was how. The college computer lab had some machines that ran Fedora, I got to know, so I asked if I could get a copy, and I did. Now, you might be wondering about the legality of the matter. Welcome to open-source and free software licensing. I will talk in detail about some other time, but as the name suggests, it is free to use and distribute. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the good things about Linux.
            </p>

            <h3>The Face Of The Darkness</h3>
            <p>
                I had heard Linux is hard to use for a beginner. And mind you, I was even below a beginner with computers, I never had a computer until a few months back. I had learned programming without an actual computer. So I wasn't going to wipe off Windows and end up having a setup that I didn't know how to use. And I didn't have an immediate person to rely on for help if I got stuck. It was me and the internet. So dual boot it was. And if the term dual boot confuses you, its just a fancy way of saying that the machine had two OS (Operating System - an essential program that acts as a bridge between the user and other software and the electrical circuit underneath), and it could use either of them -  you get a choice every time you boot - which means start- the system. So I had a freshly baked installation of Fedora, next comes getting the software that I use.
            </p>

            <h3>The War Room</h3>
            <p>
                As I set out to get the software, I was met with another piece of brilliance about Linux. The idea of repository. To keep it simple, it's like a Google Play Store or Apple App Store, you go get whatever you need, with zero hassle. We may take it for granted but let me emphasize it some more. Suppose you want a certain software, and it needs a certain other software to work. These required software are called dependencies for obvious reasons. But let's say you don't have it. You get the software you need, try to install it and either it doesn't install or it installs but don't work properly. And you have no way of knowing what is going on. Alternatively, the software could come with a copy of all the software it needs to work. But if you already had it, now you have two. While obviously that is a waste of resources, the real problem is that these two might clash. Another option is that the software that you installed lets you know it needs so and so and it wasn't there and asks you to get it yourself. Now you go hunting dependencies. Now let's look at the other side that is actually greener. In Linux repositories, when you need a package, you ask the system to install it (just like you do in Play Store), and the system automatically checks if you have all the dependencies, and downloads the missing ones without you having to worry about it. Cool, right? And you update your stuff just like Play Store as well. And do not worry you're missing out on whatever convenience the regular system offers (by which I mean how you'd do it on Windows). You can get your software how you would do it on Windows too if you want. Additionally, you can build your software from the source code, which, even though theoretically possible on Windows, is far too impractical.

            <h3>The Big Gun</h3>
            <p>
                Next difference that became apparent, is that Linux is meant to be used on the terminal. Now you definitely have seen a terminal even if you do not identify it by name. That black screen on which there's some text that makes no sense. You might have seen it on some techno movie or something, at the very least - remember the classic Matrix scene where green characters fill up a black screen? Just like that. It is also called Command Prompt or Command Line or Console or Shell or something or the other. What actually happens is that all software works off an input - output pattern. But then just to make it more easily and widely usable, a layer of visual improvements is added, albeit at the cost of some performance. This visual layer is called Graphical User Interface (GUI). Now I acknowledge that the GUI has undebatable contribution in whatever a computer is, today. But with performance, efficiency and capability in mind, terminal is like your computer gone Super Saiyan.
            </p>

            <p>
                While there is just as much GUI support in Linux as there is Win, in most Linux distros - Linux version - but a detailed discussion on what distros are is for some other time, to really feel the spirit of Linux you will have to get your hands away from the mouse/touchpad or whatever device you use as an alternative and work on the keyboard twice as hard because that is where the true power of Linux lives - in the Terminal. And that is the first thing about terminal. The mouse is almost no use there. It is all typing, the command and subcommands and whatever. So yeah, there is a lot of commands and subcommands and options and flags and what not and that is what scares people off about Linux, but believe me it is not that scary. If I did it, so can you. Whatever an average user does on Win, can be done on Linux with GUI if you want but more importantly, even on the terminal with just the same number of commands as you have letters in your name - I promise to write on this soon.

            <h3>The Face Off</h3>
            <p>
                You might wonder why there is this big of a difference in the capability of the two OS? Wouldn't it be better for business for Windows to catch up and even surpass the other? Well, that is where open-source comes in again. Windows is a locked software that you can use restrictively, given that it is the intellectual property of a corporation, but Linux being free, is totally out in the open. Hence you can feel more free as you use it.  Another part of the picture is that, Linux is free, so a lot of people are contributing to its development, while Microsoft hires people to work on Win. There is trade-off here. While Win is more polished and seamless compared to Linux, which can get a little jittery here or there, only the features that Microsoft decides to put out come in Win, but Linux offers a wider feature set.
