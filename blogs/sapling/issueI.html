                    Hello! Just a few days back I got the book, 'Meditations' by Marcus Aurelius, as a gift from my sister. Just to give you some background, I think I should say, I have been going through a very rough patch of life for the past few years. And for the past few months to be specific, I have been in a very bad shape. But then due to a certain something, I had a sudden change. Almost as if the shock of what happened, jump started my dormant self. It was only after that new wave of vitality hit me, that I decided to get this site done, and take care of various other aspects of my life, which, at this point, was a total mess. What, or why, or how that happened might be of some insight but it's a long story, and this is not the place for it. So maybe I will write about that elsewhere, some time.

                    Now, back to the point, I was already in a philosophical turmoil, and deeply shaken. I would go on to put it in a rather fancy way, which might come off as an exaggeration, but I mean it is as literally as I humanly can. "I was looking for enlightenment". My core values, the very person that I was, it all seemed to have shattered. I had questions. I needed answers. About myself, about the world, about things bigger than the world itself. I know all of this is not a part of the book. But like I said in the series overview. Books talk differently to different people, based on their state of being at the time of reading. That is the reason books can be profoundly different when read at different stages of life. For example when I read 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell when I 13, give or take 1, it seemed like a perfectly normal children's story. Animals that talk and have character and do funny things. But as I grew up, so did the book. It's not a children's story anymore. It has evolved into a masterpiece with heavy political commentary. So yeah that was a little background of the state in which I got the book in my hands.

                    Since this is the first article on the book, I'll take some time to talk about the book itself and author. Marcus Aurelius was a roman emperor, and a philosopher. He was the last of the 'Five Great Emperors'. Now history isn't my forte but it seems he was the person to whom we all owe the very concept of fundamental rights and the idea freedom, all the fancy phrases, like 'freedom of speech' and such. He used to write a journal of sorts. And eventually, his notes from there, originally written in Greek, and originally never intended for publication, were published. By whom, I read somewhere but forgot, and I don't think that very much relates to the foregoing. So the book itself is a mirror into the mind of one great person, written in a rather unconventional format. It consists of chapters which the index calls 'Book', as in 'Book I' and so on. Each chapter has several excerpts from his notes, like quotes. Some tiny small, some mighty big. Here on out I will use the following scheme to refer to excerpts,  much like the Bible, say for fifth excerpt in third chapter/'Book', I'd say, III, 5.

                    In I, 1-3,s he talks about the values he received from his grandfather Verus, father and mother. He mentions good morals, government of temper, modesty, manly character, piety, beneficence, abstinence right down to the very thoughts, and a life of simplicity, as opposed to kingly. One thing I noticed is that he mentions, <quote>'From the reputation and remembrance of my father, ...'</quote>. Now I don't know much about history, but this certainly felt unusual. I had a couple possibilities in mind. He could have been separated from his father very early, due to death or otherwise. Another strong possibility could be an entirely different interpretation of the phrase. While the other people taught him the mentioned values directly, in this case, he got to learn about the values his father stood for, from his mention by other people. So I look it up on the web and it turns out, his father died, when he was three. And his rise to throne was also a very unlikely outcome. First off, he wasn't the Emperor's son, neither was he named heir, but the heir died and the man who adopted him, after he was taken care of and brought up by his mother and grandfather, became the emperor, who then, named him the heir and so Marcus Aurelius became the 'good' emperor.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    In I, 4 he says,<br>
                    <br><blockquote>
                        'From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.'
                    </blockquote><br>
                    Now, I have held a firm disregard for the education system as we know it, for a long time. Right from the very primary levels to the college level. And on this I could talk a great length, but not here. This only goes to affirm my opinion in the matter. The second clause is a rather tricky matter. From an emperor, this is nothing short of mockery, but upon a moment of reflection, I believe he would have had the insight to see the narrowness of this idea. So there are three possibilities, one, that I interpreted it wrong, or second, he, in this particular instance, isn't talking about what he learned per se, instead, is giving out credit for certain things he received in life owing to someone, or third, since it wasn't meant for publication, he let the privileged perspective pass. Let's look at the second possibility first. The structure of the phrases, across the three clauses, are somewhat different. In the third, he uses, 'From my great-grandfather ... to know ...', which clearly implies something he learned from someone, as opposed to first and second, where doesn't use the infinitive form of the verb, but the past perfect instead, which could imply, he is talking about 'himself', having had the mentioned things owing to the person, not a general philosophical advice, so the matter now converges with the third possibility. Since he himself, talks about, liberal spending on education, it is possible that he did disregard the unaffordability of the idea. But even though that might be so, since he took the effort to write it down, he must put considerable value in it, which I do agree with. As for an alternative interpretation, he could have been talking about the value of close mentors in one's growth, that the real growth of a person, happens not in school, amid a crowd, but with someone who could be regarded as a mentor, in isolated, focussed, communications with them. Personally, I have been fortunate to have had someone I could think of as a mentor, and from that experience, I can really, vouch for this interpretation of the idea. Either way he meant it, it happens to be solid insights, and just because he didn't mean the other, doesn't diminish it's value as a suggestion.

                    <blockquote>
                        'From my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party at the games in the Circus, not a partizan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius, at the gladiators' fight; from him too, I learned endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people's affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.'
                    </blockquote><br>
                    This was a big one. It was at this point that I realized, there are bound to be references to contemporary culture and people and such, so I will have to read it slow and with background research and it was at this point that the idea of starting this series of blogs hit me. On the face value this one reads easy, even disagreeable. Let's split it into two distinct parts, firstly, <quote>'From my governor... gladiators' fight'</quote> and <quote>' ... from him too ... to slander'</quote>. The second one is rather straight forward and I do not have much to add except the last clause. By <quote>' ... not to be ready to listen to slander</quote>, my first impression was that it was an advice to stand up for one's good name. But it didn't feel right. So I looked it up, and as it turns out, the correct interpretation would be to not acknowledge the slander. By the very act of reacting to something, you acknowledge it's existence. You have the power to bring into existence, ideas. Whereas if you are prepared to not pay any heed whatsoever so much as in thoughts to what someone thinks or says about you, you automatically destroy that opinion. The followers of stoicism, of which Marcus was one, as we shall see in the later parts of the books, it seems, firmly established the idea of detachment from your own thoughts and to practice the control of one's reaction to stimuli. So the advice in this part of the writing, is to not acknowledge the slanders cast upon you, to not react and to mind your business. What someone else thinks is their business through and through. And that is some solid advice right there.

                <p>
                    Now the first part. What could be wrong with cheering a party on, like a sports team in a contemporary sense,! And what has a party,or team got to do with circus! So I set out to do some background. First off, this 'governor', he is talking about, is historically, not identified, as far as I learned. Second, if, like me, you are no good with history, and you thought this 'Circus' was the same circus we talk about today, as in Barnum circus, we thought wrong. The modern meaning of circus derives from this meaning. So as it goes, That capital C, didn't fit well with me, so I decided to look into it. Historically, Circus were huge stadium-like structures, elliptical in design that were used for public entertainment. So basically this is modern day FIFA we're talking about, not some circus. And there used to 4 faction, or teams, Red, Blue, Green and White. There are also mentions of some Gold and Purple, but for far insignificant length of time. And of these, Green and Blue were the most favored. Now its easy to understand the entire population was divided based on factions, they cheered on for. But that still doesn't answer what could be wrong with it. So, this thing actually blew out of proportions with time. People, would go to unimaginable lengths for their parties. From murder, to treachery, nothing was barred., and I am talking about the supporters, not the sportsmen. So much so that a certain party member, I don't remember the names, and by that I mean the sportsman, not the supporter, had more power and influence than the emperor himself. Another instance I can refer to is the one time an emperor had the entire stands executed or arrested, for they dared to boo the emperor's party, which he took personally. I really want to emphasize that this wasn't some people gone crazy that I am talking about. It was a historically acknowledged mass phenomena. It didn't even give place to more natural and fundamental entities like love for someone, in a romantic sense, or affection to one's own brother, or family otherwise, in general. This thing was toxic to the core and was polluting the society. I didn't specifically go look at much into the gladiator segment, but Parmularius refers to a group of gladiators, marked by small shields, and Scutarius was another, marked by huge shields. From the context, I suppose, some similar disagreeable phenomenon occurred around gladiators' fights, to which the advice was to stay neutral.

                <p>
                    Again on the face value it may seem irrelevant, in modern times. But is it really? There are two aspects of it as I see it. A macro perspective, where there are huge groups and forces at play, religion, race, caste, political ideology, and even one's gender/sexuality, I'd go so far as point towards nationality, and a micro perspective where this phenomena effect humans at an individual level. As for the first, for about 2000 years after this book was written, all of human history is painted with blood over the same principle in disguise. To establish my point a little deeply and to look into the micro scenario, let us look at the phenomenon and try to understand what really happens. It is rather superficial to think the violence, or the violent tendency is the problem. Time and again, we fall prey to the nature of not looking deep enough. We see a certain human reaction, and we call it out as good or bad. And we think our job is done. whereas in reality, human reaction is just the manifestation of a deeper layer of processing called behavior. For a human, what goes on inside is often far more real than what happens outside. And this is established by the self-destructive things we do, procrastination, gambling, even suicide. So what I see happening here is, when one associates themselves to a label and therefore a banner under which they find a place to belong, whether, religion, or nationality, or race, or, <em>hello there feminism and feminists!</em> And humans have evolved to value being in a herd, because if they didn't, they would be breakfast for sabertooth tigers. They, then, find a sense of identity, in the group. And the very nature of walking with a group dictates that one cannot walk too fast or too slow. If, to follow by this principle, one has to walk painstakingly slow, they will, or if they have to feed off the groups fastest walker to the sabertooth lurking by, they will. I would take a moment to emphasize the former situation is a personal situation while the latter is a sub-group one. What I mean is, that as an individual, one will want to step down their game, or step up, as the situation demands, but if enough people in a herd identify with a sub-group that is stepping up or stepping down, the majority group will chase their comfort and resort to the second situation. Additionally, notice that generally, and with enough time, in such situations, the individual that is the fastest walker, falls prey. This is because it is generally harder to step up the game as compared to stepping it down. So this person has to perform sub-par. But human tendency is to resist stepping down. We are a species that is curious to the core. We want to grow, rise and live out our best potential. So, there will eventually be a state where, the entire group is performing sub-par, either by compromise or by conspiracy. If this didn't convince you, think about the converse. If there is a minority that is falling behind, how often can you see a majority stepping down and for how long? Naturally the <em>unfit</em>, as Darwin called it, will perish. Herd mindset does two things. First, it dictates individual rationality, and second, it demands that every individual, in the long run, performs sub par. Owing to this behavior, therefore, you see a collective degradation. And that is precisely what happens. The more one identifies themselves with labels and banners, the more it drags them down and that was the micro aspect I was talking about.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    As a conclusion to the foregoing, let me put it like this. Every banner one identifies themselves with, controls them beyond their wildest imaginations, and if the groups are big and the sense of belonging strong, they can go to practically any extent, both to protect the group, as well as to keep identifying as one of the group, which is just a special case of of the first, of course. And throughout history, labels have been created and manipulated to manipulate countless people. And to put the final layer of skin to my monologue, let me put forth some points for you to ponder upon. At the most trivial level, comics were created for entertainment, and what entertains one is their choice. So what is the fundamental flesh under the argument of Marvel vs. DC? Or about a specific sportsman or a media personality being better than the other? Now don't mistake me here. Some clearly are so bad I am not even considering their existence in this whole picture. But again, we just associated a person with a label. You see my point?  At a slightly higher level, the very nature of mass movements like feminism is ridiculous, in my opinion, because these tend to advocate power to a label and not an individual and as a result, misuse of power which is what these stood to fight for. And therefore, I go on to insist, something can equality can never be achieved by mass movements. Do not hereby, take me for a patriarch, I acknowledge the problem. I merely don't agree with the solution being offered. At an even bigger level, we go so far to justify and celebrate mass murder and suicide in the name of nationality and call it war. What is it, if not a classic example of the foregoing. At an even bigger level, we think we as humans are a species, and therefore associate ourselves with labels that entitles us somethings and conforms some others to our perspective. For example, we chose to create something called God, that looks like us. Additionally, back to Copernicus, we so easily assumed that we were at the centre of the universe, and while that is debunked, we continue to hold countless like anthro-centric, ego-centric principles. These were all cliche examples. Let me bring out one rather unconventional one. What about a company, as in business company? Isn't it just a name that exists on paper? Just a label with a fancy logo perhaps? And yet depending on the size, hundreds to millions identify with it. And still this make-belief has so much power, it can lead to wars or even better, it can buy out entire wars, battlefield, equipment, people all included. And if you think about it, isn't a company logo just the same as a national flag, a symbol to identify by? This point actually connects closely with why I do not agree with the education system, even at its theoretically most efficient performance, it will, be derogatory as a mass phenomena. Schools and colleges are invariably, institutions of brainwashing, opinion and perspective implantation, potential mediocritization, and above all, the centre where an individual is programmed to associate psychopathically with labels and banners. That's all from me today. I'll see you around!
