                    Until a week ago, I had a dual boot Windows 7|Fedora Linux machine. And just so you know, I run an old hardware. Intel Pentium Core 2 Duo processor, 2 Gigs(geeky sounding Gigabyte) of memory and 250 Gigs HDD. So it was working for me with Win 7. Then about 4 years back, I started hearing about Linux and I had to try. I have always been into computers. From rooting Android phones to wiping the entire stock OS and installing custom OS on the phone, I have done all kinds of things. So you can guess I am the kind of person that would have to try Linux. And personal curiosity apart, Linux promised to be more powerful and run better on an old system like mine. It gave off that 'hacker vibe' and  who wouldn't want to feel that! As if all this wasn't enough it also was more used at a professional level. I mean as a physicist, I was more likely to be using Linux than Windows, so I decided to give it a shot about 4 years back. Now it wasn't my choice to get Fedora, I didn't even understand the idea of flavor/distribution(distro, as the Linux community calls it) all that well. I just knew there were various kinds, that I got to know a random Google search.

                    The college computer lab had some machines that ran Fedora, I got to know, so I asked if I could get a copy, and I did. Now, you might be wondering about the legality of the matter. Welcome to open-source and free software licensing. I will talk in detail about it in some later issue, but as the name suggests, it is free to use and distribute. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the good things about Linux.

                    I had heard Linux is hard to use for a beginner. And mind you, I was even below a beginner with computers, I hadn't even had a real computer until a few months back. I had learned programming without an actual computer and same can be said all the other stuff they teach you at school, MS Word and like. So I wasn't going to wipe off Windows and end up having a set-up that I didn't know how to use. And I didn't have an immediate person to rely on for help if I got stuck. It was me and the internet. So dual boot it was.
                    And if the term dual boot confuses you, its just a fancy way of saying that the machine boot into either of the two OS (Operating System - an essential program that makes the electrical circuit something the user can interact with), and to boot mean to start or run. So I had a freshly baked installation of Fedora, next comes getting the software that I use.

                    As I set out to get the software, I was another piece of brilliance about Linux. The idea of repository. To keep it simple, it's like a Google Play Store or Apple App Store, you go get whatever you need, with zero hassle. We may take it for granted but let me emphasize it some more. Suppose you want a certain software, and it needs a certain other software to work. These required software are called dependencies for obvious reasons. But let's say you don't have it. You get the software you need, try to install it and either it doesn't install or it installs but don't work properly. And you have no way of knowing what is going on. Alternatively, the software could come with a copy of all the software it needs to work. But if you already had it, now you have two. While obviously that is a waste of resources, the real problem is that these two might clash. Another option is that the software that you installed lets you know it needs so and so and it wasn't there and asks you to get it yourself. Now you go hunting dependencies. Now let's look at the other side that is actually greener. In Linux repositories, when you need a package, you ask the system to install it (just like you do in Play Store), and the system automatically checks if you have all the dependencies, and downloads the missing ones without you having to worry about it. Cool, right? And you update your stuff just like Play Store as well. And do not worry you're missing out on whatever convenience the regular system offers (by which I mean how you'd do it on Windows). You can get your software how you would do it on Windows too if you want. Additionally, you can build your software from the source code, which, even though theoretically possible on Windows, even is far too impractical. I know this has a lot of scary terms but it needs lengthy discussion, and I would rather do it elsewhere.

                    Next difference that became apparent, is that Linux is meant to be used on the terminal. Now you definitely have seen a terminal even if you do not identify it by name. That black screen on which there's some text that makes no sense. You might have seen it on some techno movie or something, at the very least. It is also called Command Prompt or Command Line or Console or Shell or something or the other. And that is more natural. What actually happens is that all software is just a sequence of instructions and it sometimes prints some result on the screen. And this is a command line based system, if you think about it. But then just to make it more usable, thanks to Steve Jobs, a layer of visual improvements is added, albeit at the cost of some performance. This visual layer is called Graphical User Interface (GUI). Now I acknowledge that the GUI has undebatable contribution in whatever a computer is, today. But with performance, efficiency and capability in mind, terminal is like your computer gone Super Saiyan.

                <p>
                    While there is just as much GUI support in Linux as there is Win, in most Linux distros, to really feel the spirit of Linux you will have to get your hands away from the mouse/touchpad or whatever device you use as an alternative and work on the keyboard twice as hard because that is where the true power of Linux lives - in the Terminal. And that is the first thing about terminal. The mouse is almost no use there. It all typing typing, the command and subcommands and whatever. So yeah, there is a lot of commands and subcommands and options and flags and what not and that is what scares people off about Linux, but believe me it is not that scary. If I did it, so can you. Whatever an average user does on Win, can be done on Linux with GUI if you want but more importantly, even on the terminal with just the same number of commands as you have letters in your name.

                    You might why there is this big of a difference in power? Wouldn't it be better for business for Windows to implement this too? Windows also has a terminal. Like I said, every OS is a terminal at the core. But the usability of it on Win is far too limited. The basic idea that differentiates Linux from Win is that the latter is the intellectual property of a business corporation. You see terminal is the chamber of power for a computer and with great power comes great freedom. And with great freedom, it is hard to maintain secrecy. In Win a lot of things are hidden under a layer that you cannot penetrate without actually breaking a few laws, and a good terminal just makes it that much easier. It would be like putting a rabbit in front of a cat and asking it to deny it's existence. Exactly! Meaningless. So the terminal is locked up. Whereas in Linux it's all free, so they don't make an attempt to hide anything. The magic word with almost too much power in Linux is <code>sudo</code>.

                    I will mention in the passing and talk about it at great length some other time that as a result of this free access, everyone out there has done stuff, learned stuff, and created stuff and its all there on the internet. So, it's like a huge network of people working to build something together. And you have access to all of that knowledge. Again, for free. Yes, it is somewhat chaotic but there is method and beauty in this chaos, if you dare to step in and look. If only you dare to open your eyes, you will find your eyes wide open. I am just trying to put some of it into words. I'll see you around!
