            <main class="home">
                <p>I just started teaching high school physics online. And in the very first class I came to realize that I need to write mathematical equations and to draw diagrams and the whiteboard on any online video conferencing platform wasn't suited to do that. Yes, using a graphic tablet helps, but I didn't have one and I didn't want to buy one either. So, I was looking for alternatives.</p>

                <p>With the fact that I have worked with <b>LaTeX</b> quite extensively before, that was the first thing to come to my mind. But a few moments of considering it, and I realized, it's not going to be fast enough to work as I speak. I needed something that could add similar blocks of certain commands on the fly, with the option to modify parameters, <em>macros</em>, so to speak. Much like a programming laguage functions. Now <b>LaTeX</b> allows creating macros as far as I know, but I never used it before and I wasn't feeling up for learning because <b>LaTeX</b> cannot do mathematical processing anyway, whereas a full programming language would add that benefit. So I decided to create some interface in some programming language.</p>
                
                <p>I chose <em>Python</em>  over anything else becuase:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It has some existing <b>LaTeX</b> support that I know of. With a Google search I figured it was <i>Pylatex</i>. But it was done really granular and I didn't find the interface fast enough, or maybe I judged it too quick, I just didn't want to put in the time t learn it, I guess.</li>

                        <li><em>Python</em> has great support for doing science and math. So that combined with my interface would be a great help. Among these I was certainly looking at a certain <em>Python</em>  package called <i>Sympy</i>. It's a fabulous thing that let's you carry out symbolic algebra within <em>Python</em>  and also can give the output as LaTeX.</li>
                    </ul>
                    And since I was creating a tool, I thought it might be good to create it like an importable package. Now that is one thing I never did in all my time with <em>Python</em>, so I set out to learn about that before I came back to the project. That part of the story can be found <a href="../snake_charmer/index.html">here</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>So this project <em>Latexipy</em>, is about a creating a tool in <em>Python</em> that adds intuitiveness and speed to working with <b>LaTeX</b>.</p>
