                    I usully run a very packed routine. So I got I started to move along with my day, but somewhere around late morning, I realized I felt the same feeling that plagued me weeks before. Only this was weaker for now, which doesn't take long to change, and this time I was somewhat prepared. I don't know where all this has it's beginning, I could point some loose milestones, but it's rather meaningless and far too vague. So let me put it like this. There has been a lot of little things throughout my life, to which I could credit some parts of how things are, but only in hindsight. And I believe that is the nature of mind. Everything matters, no matter how small. And since early 2016, I have only seen a descent in the state. Slow at first, sharp at places, stable occasionally but briefly, minor, upliftments, further plunge, and soon it devolved into a chaotic cycle of deterioiration and respite. And the strongest wave hit me somewhere around April 2022, and by August, same year, I tried to do what I would not put into words. I choose not to put it into words, not because I am scared or ashamed or something like that, but because after that I feel a different way about it. Something that sound of that word won't bring to your mind, so I'd rather leave that space blank and over the course of a few blogs try to fill it bit by bit. But something shifted within me in that moment. I felt flare in my belly, which was warm and had a sweet golden glow. I wanted to fix things.

                    I have always preferred to do things on my own. Okay, not not just preferred but been obsessive. And I wanted to understand myself better. So I decided to go on a journey. A journey of healing, wisdom and fulfilment. Even before, I have found a certain person of immense help. I had come to see him a person very close to me in my heart. A mentor. That person is Robin Sharma. Google up the name for more on that. Now my journey starts with me opening my heart to him through his resources. I installed into my day, the habits he preached, I did that on multiple occassions previosuly and I did see drastic results, it's just that when turbulences hit me, I couldn't hold on strongly and I got knocked over. But by now I feel I have seen turbulences and I have built myself an arsenal to tools to help me weather difficulties. One of those habits was journalling - simply put, a habit of writing down the various thoughts one goes through the day, without judgement, or filter, or cutting corners. Now for past couple weeks, I have been doing that. On normal days I don't much to write, on better days I write pages after pages of good things, and weaker days I write pages worth of insight into my mind. And multiple times I felt I wanted these words to be read. Because, I felt, it could be of value to someone, and partly because I was expressing myself very deeply and I felt having someone read it would be therapeutic for me. So today as I was struggling with myself, and as Robin said, 'feeling the feeling for healing the wound', and writing my journal, I wanted to put it over here.

                    Today I found myself feeling a weird restlessness. I sat down to meditate and I tried to concentrate on the feeling, and I could feel a emptiness sucking my energy dry. I felt a vague loneliness. It was heavy and I felt heavy. I didn't want to fetch myself a glass of water. Previously, I would give in and lay there sinking into this darkness, in fact I did, but this time, I just knew that this feeling was just a part of me, I was bigger than this. There was a lot more of me, when you removed this feeling.  That is, to say, I chose to still take charge and I chose to take the steps to healing. It was hard but things of value are hard to do. I acknowledged whatever I was feeling and with that, the fact that I was in control. That I had 'miles to go before I sleep'. I have a destiny, and dreams to fulfil. I have to do the work to leave behind the legacy I want to leave and it all started within this moment. So I had to understand this feeling and it's source more deeply. I have found loneliness to be a big part of my problems. So I decided to probe it further.

                    When I say loneliness, it is easy to mistake it. One might associate it with lack of being in company of people. No, that is <em>alone</em>. I, as a matter of fact, enjoy being alone most of the time. This is worth further discussion but this is not about it. One might, then, associate it with wanting to be with certain people. No, that is <em>missing</em> someone. Loneliness is often like loose wire-end, not attached to anyone or anything, whereas it creates a need to be. And that is what makes it so dangerous. It represents something that is missing a link, and by that I mean the place where the wire is missing from, and also something that can create links. Generally loneliness is a very subtle passive feeling and when it does come strong it is good as masking itself as some other strong feeling. Rage. Missing someone. Even horniness. It often leads to the person creating emotional link to things in a strongly addictive manner, and more often than not, these links are, in themselves, not very healthy. I'll come to that later. Manifested strongly or weakly, what doesn't change that loneliness is very crippling. It prevents the mind from being focused into anything. It drains the person's will-power and energy, both, emotional and it turns out, physical, which is often manifested as severe weight loss as a result of unwell emotional state. The person would not be able to get anything productive done, with the unfocused mind. They will exhibit unsociable behavior, which, if anything, further worsens the situation because, social life, in most cases, acts as the least harmful form of temporary respite. This passive deteriorating behaviour soon piles up into a strong sense of regret and self-loathing. And sooner or later this loose wire is bound to attach itself to something. That is where it gets to stage of serious concern.

                    Before moving on, I'd like to emphasize that one could be in a crowd of <b>acquianted, like-minded, friendly</b> people and still be lonely. So dealing with loneliness isn't as simple as making friends. And just to emphasize, I chose those adjectives to weed out the possibilities in which external factors about the crowd may be the underlying reason behind loneliness. Relief presents itself in two forms, distraction and dopamine. While distraction is not a solution, it directly isn't derogatory either. Of course, it can have indirect damage. Like the person would not get anything of value done over long periods of time, or on a more serious note, say being distracted while driving or something like that. And I have been there, and I would emphasize not to take the distraction picture ligtly. But the real devil is in the dopamine. Dopamine is the chemical our brain releases that makes us feel good. It makes us feel motivated, makes us want to do something, and if manipulated, can lead to addiction. The feel-good serves to distract from the pain one feels from loneliness, and thus, get dependent on whatever the dopamine shots are coming from. I would go further to point out that, loneliness is fast becoming a global normal, and it is being manipulated for profit. Social media is a solid example. Every like, or whatever the platform equivalent is, gives you a dopamine shot, and has you addicted, and thus creates a socket for you to attaach your sense of loneliness with. And as a result, every few minutes, you feel restless, to check on your phone, in solitude or in company. And just to make my point stronger, I do not use any form of social media for a long time. And still on days like today, I check my phone every 5 minutes, even though I don't expect to have anything there. Sometimes, I am just staring at the blank home screen, or the app list, or the notification pull-down, sometimes even at the screen while it is turned off. I have found myself addicted a lot of things in my journey, from content consumption, to games, to even working, or reading, or to some people and what not. I want to emphasize none of these things are bad in themselves, like I mentioned working, further, I'm not even going to talk about moderation, because the more you work, the better, that certainly, doesn't apply to everything, but what doesn't change is that this kind of work is harmful. No doubt about that. What happens is, something like a fast car. A fast car is good, and while in theory a car without brake is fast, it is not good. The magic word is control. While a person is in control, games, content-consumption or work are all good, but the addictive pattern put the control into the arms of the other thing. Now while, work is work, it is designed to be hard and effortful and in general not addictive, almost all other options for things to get addicted to is designed to get you addicted, game, content, social media and what not. So eventually the attachment shift from work to one of these.

                    From all this time and experience with dealing with loneliness, I have seen some wide range of possible sources. Often a hole someone or something left in your world rots into this. It could be a pet, a person you were close to, or something obvious like that. But what often gets unnoticed is that, sometimes, it could be more subtle. Say moving into a new house or a new city, could leave a blankness, that changes soon from nostalgia, into rotting pits of loneliness. Or something as simple as seemingly irrelevant lifestyle changes could lead to this. It could be growing up under a rather constricted parenting. I won't go into much detail into this here, because it is far to vast to be talked in anything but a dedicated issue. Sometimes, when you chase a dream real hard and it crashes in front of your eyes, it leaves an unfillable hole that doesn't age well. Apart from the general pattern of something leaving a hole, something that weighs on your mental state can exhibit similar conditons. Say, regret, or guilt. One thing in particular that I would like to mention is, that as humans we have a fair gauging of our own potential and capabilities and the realization that we didn't live up to it, the realization of a life that could have meant more, is pure poison. This generally gets worse with time and age. Same can be said about guilt. And more often that not, whatever the specific reason behind loneliness may be, there isn't a lot that can be done about it.

                    The big question, then, is how does one battle it. First off, I would like to say each mind is a unique labyrinth formed by a unique mix of years' worth of experiences. And therefore, to look for a universal map is a fool's quest. So all I can offer here are things that help me. Things I've learned to be of possible help to someone. The best solution is to see a professional and to try to find one's unique form of coping. Often identifying the specific reason(s) is of value. Also, of value, is noticing the parallel sufferings one is experiencing, if any, for I strongly believe, these sufferings are often interconnected and you may find several lurking underneath. As  I explored my state, I found several wounds, big and small, from many factors I talked about throughout this issue. I figured the step 1 towards healing would be to acknowledge their place in my mind and life. And that is what I did. I took time to feel the pain, forgive and let go of people and things, let go of the resentment, rebuild the shattered dreams bit my bit, accept that time was lost and potential wasted, and understand deeply that the past is gone and beyond the fact that it won't come back, acknowledge the fact that it only has as much power as we choose to give it, and that same can be said about the future. It is imperative to know that this little pocket of now is all I have and all I have to do is take very good care of it and it will take care of everything else. I found relief in giving the tornado of my thoughts, the shape of words, in the form of journal, or communication with a person close to me, now this blog. I said, I have been away from all forms of social media, I pulled back further from the noise of the modern world, viz. technology as far back as I can. Of course I am still using a laptop to type this, my point being, be mindful of what I was letting into my mental space and how it was affecting me. As I filled my hoursand therefore days with productivity, I had good things to look back to and I found hope for the future, that gives substance to the newly built dreams, and lightens the regrets. I found help in novelty and exploration, trying new things, new food, new places, new people, etc. As my mind grew, and stretched to fit what I was adding, the suffering did seem smaller in comparison. I founding help in moving my body physically, and by that I mean exercise, which, I cannot exaggerate, is a game changer. And all of these things, are neurobiochemically proven to be of help. It is all over the internet and Robin talks about it all the time. Yeah I am willingly skipping any vague terms like self-love. Because to a hungry person, the advice, <em>"Go eat!"</em> is of no value wahtsoever. An open heart and mind, and a hunger of knowledge and growth mixed with dsicipline and a little selfish eccentricity in acknowledging and protecting my mental and physical self and my power and voice in my own life brought me a long way. It still helps me get up from bed every morning and on my weaker days, it helps me pull through like while I have felt literally crippled by my own mind before I started writing this, I made myself a meal, have been of service to people, and wrote a blog in the process. I hope I gave you some hope and help! I'll see you around.
