                <p>Coming soon!</p>
                <!--<p>So, you  wanna know about me? Let's start from the beginning. But know that this is also a work in progress, as all things about this site, so it is prone to change anytime, or have stuff added, so come back once in a while. But then, am I not a work in progress too? Aren't we all?</p>
                <p>I am just an ordinary average guy. Yeah, you guessed it right, it's that song!</p>
                <p>Even since I was a tiny tot, I knew I had to be that one lucky man, who gets to be with that one beautiful woman. I wanted to be a scientist. Yeah I know, but back then it really seemed like a good idea. I had found my lady love, even before I knew who I was, and little did I know, that was recipe for disaster.</p>
                <p>So when I was in 9th grade, we had to take a course on Java. Putting aside the earlier courses on HTML, BASIC, and such languages, which for one no cared to put an effort into teaching me or so much as introducing me to the idea of programming, and for the other, I myself was far too young to understand the power of programming. Now, Java was my introduction to the art of programming and the very first look into the depth in it's eyes and I knew I found the love of my life, a second time, and then I was too young to know that was recipe for disaster, again.</p>
                <p>So, right now, I do physics, programming and I learn french and japanese and I learn to play guitar. And I love to read and to listen to music. As you might have learned from the language 'japanese', I am, well, big time into anime. I do play some games, sometimes. Not just anime, I like movies and series too.</p>-->
